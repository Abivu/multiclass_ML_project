# Multiclass Classification on a patient's length of stay in a hospital

For my final project in Supervised Machine Learning (COMP2704), I'm tackling a multiclass classification problem focused on predicting hospital length of stay. I'll be leveraging the Turicreate API to build two machine learning models: a Decision Tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Using a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, the models will analyze various factors influencing patient stay duration, including illness severity, age, hospital region, ward assignment, and city. The ultimate goal is to identify the model that delivers the most accurate predictions for stay lengths ranging from 0 to 100 days (categorized into 11 classes).

**Real-World Impact:**
This predictive model has the potential to significantly aid healthcare staff. By estimating the length of stay for each case, the model can help hospitals efficiently plan and allocate resources, such as beds and rooms. This improved efficiency can lead to better patient care and hospital operations.
